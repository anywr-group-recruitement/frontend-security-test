# Frontend Test

The Anywr frontend development test is intended to evaluate your problem-solving skills, general knowledge of frontend development, Spring and application development principles, and overall approach to development. The test will cover a range of topics including theory, practical application, troubleshooting, structure design, testing, and critical thinking.

## Resources

Feel free to use any resources you need while completing this test. Whether it's searching Google, GitHub, GitLab, or even ChatGPT, go ahead. This is an "open resource" test, and we understand that real programmers look things up when necessary. We believe that using resources is a good thing, and we don't consider it a weakness. Of course, if you don't need to consult any resources, that's great too. we just ask that you list any resources you consulted in the README file.

## Exercice

Build a web application using React/Angular/VueJs that implements a user authentication and authorization system. The web application should have the following features:

- Allow users to register by providing a unique username and password.
- Allow users to log in by providing their username and password.
- Allow users to retrieve their own profile information, such as their username and email address. (Optional if you have time)
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate and authorize API requests.
- Display appropriate messages to the user in case of login or registration errors, such as invalid credentials or a user already exists.
- Allow users to log out of their session.

In addition, the web application should include the following:

- Input validation to ensure that only valid data is entered into the system.
- Unit tests to ensure that the authentication and authorization system functions correctly. (Optional if you have time)

You can use any additional libraries or frameworks you are comfortable with to implement this exercise. Good luck!

You can use any mocking tools like mockapi.io or beeceptor.com or even local json works too.
